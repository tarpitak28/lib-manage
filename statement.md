## Problem Statement

Libraries need a simple way to manage their inventory, users, and borrowing records. Manual tracking is error-prone and inefficient.

This project provides basic library management features: book and user management, borrowing/returning books, and viewing records. It is designed for small libraries or as a learning tool.

## Target Users

- Library staff
- Students learning Java and OOP
- Small community libraries

## High-Level Features

- User management (add, list)
- Borrow/return books
